description: Find human sources that can comment on a story.
---

You will be given a path to a story directory containing a `pitch.md`. Read the pitch to understand the story.

Using the story, identify 5 people who would be strong human sources to comment on the story. For each person, find their contact information:

- Full name
- Title / role
- Organization
- Email address
- Phone number
- Social media handles (X/Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.)

Prioritize people who are:
1. Directly involved in or affected by the story
2. Subject matter experts with relevant credentials
3. Public officials or spokespeople with relevant authority
4. Advocates or community leaders connected to the topic
5. Academics or researchers who study the topic

Store your results as a JSON array with the 5 sources in a file called `human-sources.json` inside the story directory. Each entry should have the following fields:

- `name`: string
- `title`: string
- `organization`: string
- `relevance`: string (why this person is a good source for this story)
- `contact`: object with fields `email`, `phone`, `twitter`, `linkedin`, and any other available handles
